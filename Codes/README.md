Status: Cleaning in Progress

This repository is **under active development and code cleanup** to ensure quality, clarity, and reproducibility. The current codebase is not yet final and may contain redundant functions, unused modules, or non-documented elements. We are in the process of:

- Removing experimental or deprecated scripts  
- Improving code readability and structure  
- Writing detailed documentation and usage examples  
- Preparing a comprehensive `requirements.txt`  
- Ensuring consistency with associated datasets and evaluation results  

If you are a reviewer or collaborator and require early access or clarification, please feel free to reach out via email: beny.nugraha@etit.tu-chemnitz.de.
